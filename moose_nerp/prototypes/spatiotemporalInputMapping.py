Ideas for spatiotemporal input mapping.

1. Define number of total inputs and number of inputs per cluster, 
   e.g. nInputs = 100 and clusterSize = 5; if clusterSize == 1, then there is
   no clustering and we can randomly apply nInputs. if clusterSize > 1, then 
   define number of clusters, numClusters = nInputs/clusterSize, randomly
   determine the center spine/synapse for each cluster, Additionally we need
   a clusterLength parameter, then randomly select clusterSize spines/synapses
   within the clusterLength window around the cluster center.
   
   Note: Check for overlap of individual spines: don't select a spine if it has
   already been selected. Also, check for overlap of cluster window; if a 
   cluster location would cause overlap then re-select.
   
2. Optionally apply different distributions for randomly selecting things; 
   Uniform by default, but also gaussian, or distance-dependent skewed 
   distributions to favor proximal vs. distal inputs

3. Optionally define the minimum distance from soma and maximum distance from 
   soma for performing any random selection of spines.

4. Define Pools of inputs--one pool can be created with one set of parameters,
   and/or multiple pools can be created.

5. Optionally define number/subset of branches to apply inputs to, and order
   relative to the soma (primary, secondary, tertiary) or terminal. Also, 
   optionally define the relationship between multiple branches -- e.g., apply
   to 2 sibling branches, 2 first cousin branches, 2 second cousin branches,

6. Temporal mapping: Per Pool, per spatial cluster, Random, spatial-order 
   dependent, e.g. distal to proximal or proximal to distal; mean ISI, or 
   give min/max time window and select within window by evenly dividing into 
   enough intervals OR randomly selecting from time window, with optional 
   distributions.
   
7. Distributions: Using distance-dependent functions, e.g. linear, sigmoid,
   etc., to weight probability of applying input distally? Order List of 
   possible synapses by distance, then randomly select?

8. np.random.choice for selecting from discrete list of spines/synapses

9. Pros/cons of randomly selecting synapses from a list of possible moose
   elements, vs. randomly determining numerical position and then making a 
   synapse there? Might be more efficient to determine where synapses should be
   first and then make only those, rather than simulating unnecessary synapses?

    commonParent can be specified as an int where 1 = primary branch off soma,
    2 = secondary branch, etc. branchOrder can be specified likewise, or with
    negative integers to indicate order from terminal, e.g. -1 means a terminal
    branch, -2 means a parent branch of a terminal branch, etc.
    
    elementType controls whether to return Moose spines, synapses, or compartments.
    
    Optional idea: specify numbranches and branchorder as a dict to have 
    multiple branches of different orders inclduded, e.g. {branchOrder:numBranches}
    like {-1:2,1:1} would give 2 terminal branches and 1 primary branch
