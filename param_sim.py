############## First, optionally override parameters specifying model detail
#calcium and plasyesno are originally defined in CaPlasParam.py
#calcium: include or exclude calcium concentration dynamics, single tau
calcium=1
#include or exclude plasticity based on calcium
plasYesNo=1
#ghkYesNo are originally defined in SPcondparams.py
#note that if ghkYesNo=0, make sure that ghKluge = 1
ghkYesNo=0
#spineYesNo originally defined in SpineParams.py

#No point adding synapses unless they receive inputs
synYesNo=1

# The parameter single only used in SPnetSpineSim.py
# set single=1 to create a single neuron of each type with synaptic input 
# set single=0 to create a network (in which case spines are a bad idea)
single=1
# For now, don't create spines if creating a network of neurons

#Second, specify which graphs of the simulation should be shown?

######################plotcurr indicates whether to plot time dependent currents (or conductances)

# graphsyn indicate whether to plot the synaptic inputs

#whether to plot the various ion channel activation and inactivation curves
