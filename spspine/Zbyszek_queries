1. single should not be defined in the d1d2/__init__.py
OR, it should be able to be overridden in param_net.py

4. d1d2/, ca1/ etc should be at same level, not below spspine prototypes

7. possibly want to give shape_Shifter its own repo (and possibly rename it)

9. comp_list = moose.wildcardFind(postcell + '/##[TYPE=Compartment]')

BUT, we need to determine Compartment or SymCompartment after loadModel, and pass this comptype to whether we use above
